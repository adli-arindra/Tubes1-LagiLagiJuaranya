The player is the programmer of the bot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write a program for the brain of the bot. The program is telling how the bot must behave and react to events occurring in the battle arena.</p><h2 id="the-name-robocode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-name-robocode"><span>The name &quot;Robocode&quot;</span></a></h2><p>The name <em>Robocode</em> originates from an <a href="https://robocode.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older version of the game</a> and is a short for &quot;Robot code&quot;. With this new version, the world &quot;bot&quot; is used instead of &quot;robot&quot;.</p><h2 id="purpose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose"><span>Purpose</span></a></h2><p>The game is designed to help you learn how to program and improve your programming skills and have fun while doing it. Robocode is also useful when studying or improving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> in a fast-running real-time game.</p><h2 id="the-name-tank-royale" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-name-tank-royale"><span>The name &quot;Tank Royale&quot;</span></a></h2><p>Robocode&#39;s battles take place on a battlefield, where small automated tank bots fight it out until only one is left like a Battle Royale Game. Hence, the name <em>Tank Royale</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Please notice that Robocode contains no gore, no blood, no people, and no politics. The battles are simply for the excitement of the competition that we love so much.</p></blockquote><h3 id="example-of-a-robocode-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-of-a-robocode-battle"><span>Example of a Robocode battle</span></a></h3><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="Battle screenshot"></p>',12),l=[i];function s(h,c){return a(),o("div",null,l)}const p=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","intro.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/articles/intro.html","title":"What is Robocode?","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Introduction","slug":"introduction","link":"#introduction","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The name \\"Robocode\\"","slug":"the-name-robocode","link":"#the-name-robocode","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Purpose","slug":"purpose","link":"#purpose","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The name \\"Tank Royale\\"","slug":"the-name-tank-royale","link":"#the-name-tank-royale","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Example of a Robocode battle","slug":"example-of-a-robocode-battle","link":"#example-of-a-robocode-battle","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1692556283000},"filePathRelative":"articles/intro.md"}');export{p as comp,m as data};
